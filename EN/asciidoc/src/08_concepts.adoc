== Cross-cutting Concepts

.Content
This section describes crosscutting concepts (practices, patterns, regulations or solution ideas).
Such concepts are often related to multiple building blocks. 
They may include many different topics, such as the topics shown in the following diagram:

image::08-concepts-EN.drawio.png["Possible topics for crosscutting concepts"]

.Motivation
Concepts form the basis for _conceptual integrity_ (consistency, homogeneity) of the architecture. 
Thus, they are an important contribution to achieve inner qualities of your system.

This is the place in the template that we provided for a cohesive specification of such concepts.

Many of these concepts relate to or influence several of your building blocks. 

.Form
The form can be varied:

* concept papers with any kind of structure
* example implementations,especially for technical concepts
* cross-cutting model excerpts or scenarios using notations of the architecture views

.Structure
Pick **only** the most-needed topics for your system and assign each a level-2 heading in this section (e.g. 8.1, 8.2 etc).

DO NOT ATTEMPT to cover all of the topics of the aforementioned diagram.


.Further Information

Some topics within systems often concern multiple building blocks, hardware elements or development processes.
It might be easier to communicate or document such _cross-cutting_ topics at a central location, instead of repeating them in the description of the concerned building blocks, hardware elements or development processes.

Certain concepts might concern **all** elements of a system, others might only be relevant for a few.
In the diagram above, logging concerns all three components, whereas security is relevant only for two components.
