:version 7.0:
:downloads https://github.com/arc42/arc42-template/raw/master/dist/:

arc42 - the template for effective, practical and pragmatic software architecture
documentation and communication.

Initially created by Dr. Gernot Starke and Dr. Peter Hruschka (way back in 2005...),
free and open source.


This repository contains all downloadable versions plus the (AsciiDoc)
source of the arc42 template.


It is used to:

*  generate (by the https://github.com/arc42/arc42-generator[arc42-generator] project) the official download
formats (i.e. docx, markdown, docbook and others).
* maintain structure, content and help for the template
* keep non-asciidoc formats (like EAP).

In case you find issues within the template or its explanations,
this is the repo to fix and issue pull requests :-)
