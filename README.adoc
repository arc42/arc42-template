arc42 - the template for effective, practical and pragmatic software architecture
documentation and communication.

Initially created by Dr. Gernot Starke and Dr. Peter Hruschka (way back in 2005...),
free and open source.


This repository contains all downloadable versions plus the (AsciiDoc)
source of the arc42 template.


It is used...

*  as the basis for generating (by the https://github.com/arc42/arc42-generator[arc42-generator] project) the official download formats (i.e. docx, markdown, docbook and others). To generate, THIS repo is included as submodule from the generator project. Use the gradle build contained here just for preview! 
* to maintain structure, content and help for the template
* to keep non-asciidoc, non-generable formats (like Sparx(R) Enterprise-Architect(R) EAP).

In case you find issues within the template or its explanations, this is the repo to fix and issue pull requests :-)

== Revisions
* 8.2: Jan 28th 2023: Thx to A. Bentele, added imagedir def to all files, for easier editing asciidoc. See #178

== Diagrams
We intend to provide all diagrams in platform-neutral formats, mainly `drawio`. 

The source of these diagrams is embedded in a `.png` file. To make this explicit, we use the combined extension `.drawio.png` for our diagrams.
The drawio tools will recognize this and open such files in the editor instead of an image viewer.

Therefore we will gradually remove all files under `./graphics-originals`



== Downloads

Please refer to the https://arc42.org/download[official download page] for
all downloads.

== Languages

The EN and DE versions are actively maintained by the founders (G.Starke & P.Hruschka).
Translations to additional languages (see below) have been provided by volunteers, but won't be automatically updated.

== Build the HTML version 

In case you want to build the HTML version of the template, just checkout this repo and call

----
$> gradle asciidoctor
----

on the command line.
To select another language set the Gradle build property `LANGUAGE` to one of the provided languages, cf.

[source, java]
----
include::gradle.properties[]

C# arc42 Documentation Builder

This Gradle project builds the arc42 documentation template in multiple formats (HTML and PDF) and supports multiple languages.

## Project Structure

The project assumes the following directory structure:

```
<root>/
  ├── DE/                     // German language files
  │    └── asciidoc/            // AsciiDoc source files
  │         ├── arc42-template.adoc  // Main document for German
  │         └── src/             // Included files
  │
  ├── EN/                     // English language files 
  │    └── asciidoc/            // AsciiDoc source files
  │         ├── arc42-template.adoc  // Main document for English
  │         └── src/             // Included files
  │
  ├── images/                // Shared images for all languages
  │    └── *.png, *.jpg, etc.   // Image files
  │ 
  └── build/                  // Generated output
       ├── DE/                  // German output
       │    ├── html/           // HTML output
       │    └── pdf/            // PDF output
       │
       └── EN/                  // English output
            ├── html/           // HTML output
            └── pdf/            // PDF output
```

## Requirements

- Java 11 or newer
- Gradle 8.0 or newer (or use the included Gradle wrapper)

## Configuration

Language configuration is done in the `gradle.properties` file:

```properties
# Configure languages to be built (comma-separated list)
languages=DE
```

The project name is set to 'arc42-template' in the settings.gradle file.

You can add multiple languages by separating them with commas:

```properties
languages=DE,EN,FR
```

## Building Documentation

### Clean the build directory

```bash
./gradlew clean
```

### Build all formats for all configured languages

```bash
./gradlew
```

or

```bash
./gradlew asciidoctorAll
```

### Build only HTML for all configured languages

```bash
./gradlew asciidoctorHtmlAll
```

### Build only PDF for all configured languages

```bash
./gradlew asciidoctorPdfAll
```

### Build specific language in HTML format

```bash
./gradlew asciidoctorHtmlDE
```

Replace `DE` with the desired language code.

### Build specific language in PDF format

```bash
./gradlew asciidoctorPdfDE
```

Replace `DE` with the desired language code.

## Output

Generated documentation will be available in the build directory:

- HTML: `build/<LANGUAGE>/html/`
- PDF: `build/<LANGUAGE>/pdf/`

For example, German (DE) documentation would be in:
- `build/DE/html/arc42-template.html`
- `build/DE/pdf/arc42-template.pdf`

## Adding a New Language

1. Add the language code to the `languages` property in `gradle.properties`
2. Create the necessary AsciiDoc source files for the new language
3. Run the build
